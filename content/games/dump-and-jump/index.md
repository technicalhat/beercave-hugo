## Holy Crab!
  
It's curry night, and Beerman's favourite curry house has been overrun by an an army of gentleman crabs! 
  
But no top-hatted upper-class crustacean can come between Beerman and a vindaloo... 

 Guide our hero around the restaurant, collecting the curries and 'delivering' them to the bathroom, but watch out for those swanky shellfish. If the heat gets too much, you can slow them down by leaving them a little 'present'.
