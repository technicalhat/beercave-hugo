# Get the beer. Kill the baddies. Save the world!

## They came for our beer...

The evil aliens of planet Lagertron have invaded the pub.

Their mission : *drink all the beer!*

## The Mighty Beerman!

Powered by his insatiable thirst, Earth's drunkest warrior must repel this invasion before chucking-out time lest the world be lost to the horrors of sobriety.

This is videogaming at it's finest.
