eerman's local is having a week of metal gigs. Unfortunately, some lunatic roadie is hurling hammers from the back of the tour bus. Fortunately, as a seasoned headbanger, our hero can survive multiple direct blows to the top of the head, Can you navigate Beerman to the bar and back and survive a whole week of METAL?

Head Banger is more-or-less a remake of Jeff Minter's "Headbangers Heaven", made for One Game a Month July 2013 where the theme was METAL \m/.
