> ___'twas the night before Christmas and Santa was mad___  
> _His fill of those naughty kids he'd just about had  
> This year would be different, he'd show that bad lot  
> He set off on his sleigh with a vengeful plot_
  
> _He'd filled up on curry, and foaming dark ale  
> His bowels were loaded, his plan could not fail  
> That bright Christmas morning, they'd find in dismay  
> A brown stocking filler to darken their day_
  
That's right. Santa's finally snapped and he's out for revenge on the naughty kids. Guide a revenge-crazed St. Nick through the many rooms of this festive platforming adventure and give those bad kids a brown Christmas they'll never forget.

Originally developed for One Game a Month 2013, Brown Christmas is back for 2014 with enhanced graphics and an all new soundtrack.
