The theme for One Game a Month in march was "Rogue". Roguelikes are boring though, and don't have enough explosions and lasers. You know what's cool though? Robotron. Robotron is fucking cool.

So imagine a better world; a world where Rogue was made by Eugene Jarvis. The world of Rogueotron

Features:
* Lasers!
* Gratuitous pixel shatter effects.
* Procedurally generated map
* Epic bullet-hell boss battle.
