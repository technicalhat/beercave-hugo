A simple voxel-based game inspired by the classic trench run scene from Star Wars. 

A little bit of endless runner, a little bit of Flappy Bird and a little bit of Star Wars. Guide your THXWing down an endless space trench, but watch out for 
those carelessly placed pipes!

Built in a week for ROM 2015. There's only minimal sound, but I recommend sticking the Imperial March on in the background when you're playing it - really adds to the ambience.
