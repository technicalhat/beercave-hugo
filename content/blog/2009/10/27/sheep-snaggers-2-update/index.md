SS2's starting to come together a bit now. Still doesn't have that classic Defender twitch feel going on, but the basic groundwork's in place now. Just need to make it _fun_...

Spent a bit of time at the weekend gutting the mode switching code, cos the appalling half-arsed state machine I had in there really wasn't up to scratch.

Swapped it out for a scene-based system that's much easier to work with, then used that as the basis of a level switching system that seems to be working out OK.

Next thing on the list is probably going to be lives and scoring, but I wasn't really in the mood tonight. Instead, I spent a bit of time twatting about with a cheesy scanline effect.
