Had another little play around with SS2 last night. Got my sheep going "baa" now, which adds a little bit of ambience.

Just playing random baas though, it's not obvious that it's actually the sheep doing it and not just background noise, so I added a little something to highlight that.

Give the little buggers a whole lot of personality, I reckon - I might just have to expand this approach to more of my sound effects :D

One thing I'm not keen on is the volume on the baas is the same no matter where you are in relation to the sheep. Think my next job will have to be rewriting my sound code to let me play with the stereo position for some quick and dirty positional audio...
