Spent the weekend mucking around with Flash - specifically, the rather nifty <a href="http://flixel.org">Flixel</a> game library. 
So to test it out I knocked together a fun little game that goes by the name of <a href="/content/arse-monkeys">Arse Monkeys</a>

Needs a little polish in the graphics department, but* it was surprisingly easy to put together. Looks like Flixel has some serious potential for future Beercave releases :D

* hehe - I said "butt"!
