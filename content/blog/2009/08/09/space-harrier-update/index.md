Been a busy weekend, but I managed to find half an hour tonight to play with the Space Harrier code.

Refactored a few things for readability and general tidiness - shadows are now handled as a class rather than just a special case of Sprite, and die along with their parent rather than hanging around in spooky fashion.

Added some basic explosion effects using <a href="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/">Cliffski</a>'s <a href="http://www.positech.co.uk/content/explosion/explosiongenerator.html">explosion generator</a>. Needs a bit of work to fit in with the rest of the game, but it'll do for now.

All working, but everything feels a bit wrong at the minute. The enemies leap around way too fast to track, so actually hitting them is a bit of a lottery.

*sigh*

Guess I'll just have to *force* myself to spend a whole lot of time this week playing the real thing to get an idea of how gameplay should feel.

It's a hard life ;)
