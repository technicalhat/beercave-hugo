I found the rather excellent looking <a href="http://www.3d-heroes.net/">3D Heroes</a> via the TIGsource forums.

I love the 3D pixellated look they've got going on there - think I might have found the aesthetic I was looking for for my <a href="/tags/space-harrier">Space Harrier</a> game.

One of the main things holding me back from playing with any 3D development is that my programmer art skills just aren't up to the job - this might just be a way around that :D
