We now have rudimentary joystick support!

Don't know if I'll get a chance to add an option to configure the button layout, so for now it's button 1 to thrust, button 2 to fire and button 3 to bomb, which works pretty well with my USB dualshock adapter.  I can probably add some kind of config file to set up the buttons, doubt I've got the time to write any UI though.

Steering with the stick feels way more like classic Sinistar, rather than the Asteroids style rotation with the keys.
