_Finally_ finished coding on [Sheep Snaggers 2](/content/sheep-snaggers-2). Been a bit of a hectic week, not helped by me being struck down by the dreaded Man Flu.

I spent most of today alternately between dozing on the couch (that damn man Flu again), deciding I was all done, and thinking "crap, I missed a bit" and coding frantically to implement piddly unimportant features like having more than one life... All done now though, and I'm pretty pleased with the end result.

The final build is uploading now. I'll be putting the download link live sometime tomorrow after the official launch at Retrovision 2011. Watch this space!
