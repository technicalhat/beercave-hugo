I aten't dead.

So the weekly blog/daily update thing never quite took off. I've managed to at least maintain some development momentum though. I've added the world map and territories to the board and got the add chip mechanic in place, and the board currently looks a bit like this:

Not exactly pretty I know, but I've got pretty much all the UI elements in place now so I can make sure the server code is behaving. Right now I'm in the middle of implementing the Wrath card mechanic, so that the various gods can lay down some almighty smitings!

Hopefully I can get the rest of it in place fairly early tomorrow, then there's just the conversion mechanic and victory conditions left to do before I start work on the shiny 3D front-end stuff.
