I've had a fairly busy week here at the beercave. Pretty much all the vital gameplay elements for Sheep Snaggers 2 are now in place. Check out the video below of me playing through a full game.

Things I've added:

<li>MechaMarkie now bigger and scarier</li>
<li>Multiple collision zones on MechaMarkie. Shoot him in the face to defeat him</li>
<li>Destroy the factory with your Sheepikaze glider bombs to activate 'Curry Time' level transition mini-game.</li>
<li>Swapped the boring enemy explosions for a way sexier pixel-shatter effect</li>
<li>Limited enemy spawns to a fixed upper limit to stop things getting too crazy too early</li>
<li>All enemies now spawn off screen - stops them sneakily appearing on top of you</li>

Jobs for next week:

<li>Mecha Markie is suitably huge and menacing, but not really much of a threat right now. Need to give him some weapons. I'm thinking laser eyes and get that big cannon working</li>
<li>Get the player death sequence looking a bit better. I like the way it crashes but I'm not keen on the flame effect, need to get the pixel shatter explosion in there too</li>
<li>Curry time needs a bit of tweaking. The idea's there but it's not really balanced just yet.</li>

That should be more than enough to keep me busy for a while.
