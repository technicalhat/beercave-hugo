I was getting a bit bored with the old site layout so I decided to spruce things up a bit around here.

Nothing drastic, I just quickly whipped up a 2 column layout with <a href="http://960.gs/">960gs</a>, dropped on the old colour scheme, and tweaked how posts were displayed.

I'm quite pleased with how it's turned out. I'm thinking next up I could do with a new logo. The old one's been knocking around since 2008 now and I've never been entirely happy with it.
