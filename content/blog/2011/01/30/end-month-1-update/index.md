It's been a couple of weeks since I posted last so I figured it was time for an update on the current state of Sheep Snaggers 2.

Right now, the game is fully playable, if not anywhere near complete. The engine work is all pretty much done now so from here on in I should be able to focus on nothing but gameplay. Which is nice.

Here's where I was at the end of last week.

Since then I've fully enabled player collisions (you actually need to avoid the aliens now), added a pause function, scoring and a title screen. I also tweaked the enemy 'hunter' AI to make them go for the nearest sheep rather than pick one at random, which seems to have improved the pace of the game a little.

Currently, it's looking like this:

You might notice the video looks a little juddery in places. I'm not entirely sure what's going on there but since it doesn't happen in normal play I think it's related to <a href="http://www.fraps.com/">Fraps</a> slowing everything down to 30FPS to record the video.

The next things I want to add are the enemy fighters (the little red bastards from the original game) and some sort of enemy base where the hunters take the abducted sheepies to in order to carry out their dastardly schemes. 
Currently they just head for an invisible point on the map where the sheep disappear and respawn, which isn't very satisfying. I'm thinking some kind of sheep processing factory with a big funnel on the top that the sheep get dropped into (maybe one last chance for a sheepie save there?).

There's plenty more to come, but that lot should keep me more than busy for the next week or so.  Hopefully I'll manage to keep the updates a bit more regular from here on in.
