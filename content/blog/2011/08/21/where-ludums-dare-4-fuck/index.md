Un-be-FUCKING-lievable.

So there I was thinking I was just about in place to sneak in something before the end of the competition when Windows decided it was a really good time to lock the fuck up and force a restart. Not the end of the world, right? Unfortunately, when it came back up the level file that I've spent the last 2 days building had been replaced with 140k of NULLs. Not good.

Looks like all the logic and models are still in one piece at least, so if I can somehow reconstruct everything from <a href="http://yfrog.com/z/h0fnjnqp">this screenshot</a> in the next couple of hours I might just get something in after all. What the fuck, it's worth a shot...
