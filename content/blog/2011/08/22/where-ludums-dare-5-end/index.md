I did it! Fuck yeah! Alright, so it's not the greatest game in the world - it's not even a tribute - but I finished a game in 48 hours, which ain't bad going considering I'd never even _touched_ Unity before yesterday morning.

I'm just waiting for the source to upload now and then I can submit my entry and get some well-deserved rest because I'm really quite knackered...

Oh yeah - I should probably include a link to the finished game. Here you go : [GET TO THE CHOPPAH!!!](/content/get-choppah)
