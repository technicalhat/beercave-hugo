Ok, so after a good night's kip I checked in on the LD website to find that the theme this time around is __Escape__. I lost no time in _immediately_ relocating myself to the coffee shop for bacon butties and pondering. _And I have a plan!_

My entry will now be titled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPIO86jTrQQ">"Get to the Choppah!!!"</a>. You are a spy who has been parachuted into an enemy military base to steal secret documents or something, and you have to escape and meet up with a stealth helicopter waiting outside the base.

Now to knock up some basic models to get me started. Guess the first things I need are a spy, an enemy soldier, a couple of buildings and a helicopter.
