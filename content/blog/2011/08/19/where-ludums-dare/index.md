As I mentioned in my [last post](/2011/08/16/playing-gods-first-steps), I'm going to be spending the weekend brushing up my Unity skills by entering the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> 48 hour game making contest, which begins in about 4 hours time.

Since that's around 3am local time, I'm obviously not planning on diving straight into the coding there and then. Haven't decided yet whether I should stay up late enough to see what the theme is and sleep on it or just wait until morning and find out then. Either way, the plan is to sketch out some ideas over breakfast at <a href="http://www.beyondcoffeecafe.co.uk/">my local coffee shop</a>, then repair to the Beercave and make a start on whatever I come up with.

Whatever I manage to bash together over the weekend, it's a safe bet that the graphics will be awful (or at best, _very_ abstract), so I guess I'm gonna just have to concentrate on gameplay. Anyway, I'll update in the morning, once I know what's going on.
