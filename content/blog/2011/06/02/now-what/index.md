So with [Sheep Snaggers 2](/content/sheep-snaggers-2) all done with (pending [bug fixes](/2011/06/01/found-problem) passing testing), I guess it's time to find a new project to play with. 

Which of course brings me to the eternal quandary of the indie developer :

### Which one of my countless unrealised ideas do I work on next?

<!--more-->

Sensibly,I should probably pick up a fairly small, self-contained project that will let me fix up some of the crappier parts of the engine I built under SS2 and leave the gigantic world-spanning epics for a later date. <br/>Which means my steampunk biplane combat game set in a massive persistent 3D world full of armoured Zeppelins and giant landtrains and sentient self-configuring fortresses* might have to wait a while.


<h3>Meanwhile, back in sensible developer world...</h3>
Of the less epic ideas I have, the best options pretty much boil down to the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Arena Chainsawer</strong><br/>
Basically the same setup as your standard Arena Shooter, only without the shooting. Surrounded by the various monsters/zombies/whatever, your only weapon is a constantly running chainsaw which you have to keep fueled.</li>
<li><strong>Mini Action Roguelike</strong><br/>
Elevator pitch: I'm pretty much thinking of a hybrid of <a href="http://www.desktopdungeons.net/">Desktop Dungeons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_(arcade_game)">Gauntlet</a>. I like a lot of the RPG mechanics in your average <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">Roguelike</a>, what with the leveling, changing equipment, spells etc., and I loved the 10-minute gameplay idea from Desktop Dungeons. But at a core level, I still love to run around and shoot things! <br/>So I'm thinking of something that combines the gameplay of Gauntlet with the quick-fix gameplay of DD and the long term depth of Rogue. Could be fun.
</li>
<li><strong>Asset-less shooter</strong><br/>
Pretty much your standard vertical/side-scrolling shooter(haven't decided which yet), only all the graphic assets are replaces by text sprites. So your ship looks something like:
<pre> P
LAY
ER1
</pre>
the enemies look like:
<pre>   BOSS
   BOSS
  GBOSSG
 U     U
N      N
</pre>
and the bullets are
<pre>PEW!</pre>
and
<pre>BO
MB</pre>
I can't draw to save my life so I'm thinking this could be a pretty cool looking way to get around that...
</li>
</ul>

What I'm thinking right now is I should knock up some quick prototypes and see what works well. If there's anything you'd particularly like to see though, well, there's a comment section right below there and it'd be nice to have something <i>not</i> written by Russian spammers in the approval queue for a change...
