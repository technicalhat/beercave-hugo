The updated version of [Sheep Snaggers 2](/content/sheep-snaggers-2) is now available for <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/SheepSnaggers2.zip">download</a>.


As well as the performance fix for the [schoolboy error](/2011/06/01/found-problem) in the original release, I also corrected a major oversight in the original game.

One of the first questions I was asked when demoing it at <a href="http://www.retrovision.co.uk">Retrovision</a> was "why can't you shoot Markie up the arse?" Seems obvious in retrospect, but somehow during development it never occured to me!

This shameful faux-pas has now been corrected - although in the interests of balance you'll have to deal with Markie's newly acquired rear defenses...

Yes. Yes I did go there.
