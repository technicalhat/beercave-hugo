It's beginning to dawn on me that I may be a bit crap at the whole mercenary capitalist bastard thing.

I released [Lagertron](/content/lagertron-1664) on Play almost a month ago now - if I had even the slightest shred of commercial instinct in my body then I would have spent the last 28 days frenziedly pimping it out at every opportunity. As it is, aside from a couple of tweets and a Facebook post around launch time, I haven't even gotten around to a proper launch announcement.
So - hey, everyone! <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.cobeercave.lagertron">Lagertron is now available for Android</a>. As far as I can tell from a cursory search of the Play store, it's the nearest thing to Robotron for Android that there is right now.

Anyway, what's next for Beercave Games, I hear you ask. Well, we just relocated the beercave again, and between finishing off the unpacking and various impending social commitments around Christmas and all that I'm not expecting to have much in the way of free time to dedicate to game dev activities, at least not when I'm likely to be in a productive state.

With that in mind, I'm planning on taking a few weeks off for a spot of mindless consumption - catch up on a few of the games I've had sitting neglected on my PC for a while now, watch some TV, enjoy a few tasty fermented beverages and figure out what I want to work on next. I'm thinking maybe I should stop twatting around and finally make Gun Bastard...
