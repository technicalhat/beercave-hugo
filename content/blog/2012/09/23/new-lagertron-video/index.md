Got most of the game in place and working now. Pretty much all that's left is to add a whole bunch of level definitions and I should have a full playable game ready for RV next weekend.


{{< youtube BjlBcRnScFE >}}


New stuff in this build:
<ul>
<li>Animated the various characters. Nothing fancy, just enough to add a little personality.</li>
<li>All enemies now have distinct behaviours</li>
<li>Autofire option targets nearest enemy</li>
<li>Scores and high score table</li>
<li>Fixed up all the collision boxes - some of them were way off</li>
</ul>


I'm really pleased with how this has turned out. After the ongoing clusterfuck that was DST it's nice to have a well-defined template to riff on, got me actually enjoying the whole game-making process again. :)
