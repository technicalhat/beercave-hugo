So Lagertron is pretty much complete as a game now. Few minor fixes and a little bit of polish and I should have something fit for release. 

And as luck would have it, it's once again time for the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/09/27/announcing-october-challenge-2012/">Ludum Dare October Challenge.</a> You <a href="/category/tags/october-challenge">may remember</a> I made an attempt at it a couple of years ago, only to be brought down by an overly-ambitious game attempt that never got finished.

This time around though, I've already got most of a working game ready to go, and based on the reactions I got demoing it at Retrovision this past weekend I should have at least a few sales in the bag too :)

So, the tentative plan is to focus on the mobile version for now, maybe add some online high scores and some kind of tutorial/practice mode (one thing I did notice is that the controls were confusing the hell out of a lot of people) and bung it up on the Play store. I'm thinking one paid version and one ad-supported would be ideal.


If there's time, I'd also like to finish up the desktop version and release that somewhere too. Will need some serious testing on machines that aren't mine before release though, for all the crying I hear about Android "fragmentation", it's got nothing on the state of the PC market.
