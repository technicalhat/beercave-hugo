Not so very long ago, someone around these parts said something very much like this:

> [Still, I think I've pretty much found my toolset for the forseeable - Unity for 3D and heavy lifting, Java/libGDX for smaller stuff. I'm hoping to be able to bang out smallish mobile games reasonably quickly](/2012/02/23/state-play)

You'd think I'd know by now not to go making grand pronouncements of The Way Things Are Gonna Be - seems like it's a great way to bring about Change.

So what happened this time? Well, it seems those nice chaps at Unity decided to make the <a href="https://store.unity3d.com/index.html">iOS and Android versions available for FREE for the next month</a>. Since free stuff is my very favourite kind of stuff, obviously I grabbed them as soon as their servers stopped melting.

Which leaves me with a minor dilemma. Do I carry on working with libGDX as my mobile development platform, thereby suffering the twin pains of building my own damn engine and having to code in bloody Java, or do I switch to developing exclusively with Unity, thus allowing me to once more get my C# on at the cost of losing the stuff I've done so far?

For future projects, it seems like a no-brainer, but Droidy Shooty Thing's pretty much done bar the polishing now. Not sure if the productivity gains I'd get from having a solid platform under me and a language I actually like would outweight the cost of rebuilding it from scratch...
