I seem to be making a bit of a habit of this last-minute exploit-every-second-of-the-grace-period thing... Yep, the racing game is <a href="/games/1gam-2013/beercave-racer">done</a> - for certain values of "done". I'm not 100% happy with it, but the whole point of 1GAM is "quit fucking around and release something", so that's what I'm doing.

So yeah, there were two major problems here:
<ol>
<li>I massively underestimated the amount of work involved in this one. After reading a couple of articles about the rendering tech I figured "yeah, I can hack that together in a weekend or so." And I wasn't wrong. Building an actual game on top of it though - that's an entirely different kettle of fish...</li>
<li>After pushing it back to May, it didn't entirely help that 3 of my weekends were pre-booked for <a href="http://www.revivalretroevents.com/">Retro Revival</a> and a family holiday to Disneyland Paris, so I really only got an extra week out of it and I was knackered for most of that.</li>
</ol>

So in conclusion, I need some goddamn <i>rest</i>. June's game is going to be about the most minimal thing I can think of right now, pretty much 1-dimensional digital <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling">curling</a> where you shoot a dot at a target. Maybe I'll try something crazy and ambitious in July, but right now I need some downtime before I flip my shit.
