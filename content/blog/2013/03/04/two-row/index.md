Damn, that was a close one. The trip to Texas ended up eating a bit more of my dev time than I'd expected since it took me a good few days to get back into gear once we returned. 

Luckily, #1GAM comes with a 96 hour grace period for submissions, which worked out nicely to give me an extra weekend to play with before the deadline.

Proper post to follow with a bit of a post mortem and announcement of this month's game, but for now here's <a href="/games/junohunter-prologue">Juno Hunter : Prologue</a>
