I'm beginning to notice a bit of a pattern developing with my #1GAM projects. I make a great start the first couple of weeks, then right around week 3 I hit a wall. It tends to go a little like this:

* *Week 1. I have an AWESOME IDEA and quickly hack together a prototype.
* *Week 2. I flesh out the prototype and end up with a basic implementation of my game idea. With two more weeks to polish this I'm gonna have something AMAZING to show by the end of the month.
* *Week 3. Ah, fuck this. I'm tired and nobody cares about my bullshit games anyway. This was a stupid idea, I'm gonna drink some beers and play a real game instead.
* *Week 4. OSHITDEADLINEAAAARGHHACKHACKHACKCUTCUTCUTRELEASE

So like clockwork, phase 3 kicked in at the weekend and I didn't get a damn thing done, so once again I'm faced with a frenzied sprint to get something finished before the deadline.

There's no way I can keep repeating the same mini-burnout cycle for the whole of 2013 without losing what's left of my marbles so I'm gonna need to step the schedule back and not try and work on this every day - as a wise man once said, "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it."
