So yeah, slight change of plan on the March game front. The theme for this month is "Rogue", which I was planning on just ignoring and doing my own thing again, but it's been nagging at me a little. Trouble is, roguelikes tend to be all turn-based and about planning and stuff, which isn't really my style. Lasers and explosions, that's me.

But then today I hit upon the ideal solution - I get to play with some roguelike tropes while still getting to shoot things and have them explode all over the place. Plus, I get to indulge my love of awful puns.

I've got some procedural map generator code that I originally wrote for Gun Bastard lying around somewhere as well, should be able to dig that out and plug it in and then that's most of a game right there.
