_Looks at calendar. Looks at game. Looks at calendar again. Looks back at game..._

So yeah, basically there ain't no way in hell I'm getting this one out by the end of the month. Work's hotting up and seriously messing with my free time, and there's just too much of a learning curve given that it's a genre I've not played in before. Similarly, there ain't no way in hell I'm failing #1gam at this point - I've dropped more than half a year on this thing so far and I'm damn well gonna make it to the end. And yes, I am mainly motivated by not losing that sweet, sweet XP bonus accumulator for sequential releases and I'm not ashamed to admit it!

All of which means I need to switch gears to something a little smaller in scale that I can realistically get working in a couple of weekends. Preferably something that fills in at least a few gaps in what I need to know before I can do something decent with Philosofist, because I really love the idea and don't want to waste it on something that sucks.

So what I'm thinking is, if I take what I've got and strip it back a bit I can probably hack out a halfway decent endless runner, and with a bit of luck add some kind of punching mechanic that'll let me test-drive the fighting physics I need on a smaller scale. Then I can hopefully build on that next month and have Philosofist be actually good and not just some half-assed rush job.
