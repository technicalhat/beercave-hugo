Finally got a chance to make a start on November's game this weekend, and so far it's going rather nicely.

Saturday was mostly spent updating the vector graphics code from <a href="/games/1gam-2013/candy-castle-chaos">Candy Casle Chaos</a> to use GL2, meaning with a bit of luck I might get to start playing with some shader effects this time around. With that sorted (and CCC's menu screen appropriated to get things up and running), I spent a few hours today getting the basics of the game in place. So far it looks a bit like this.

If I can find a couple of hours this week to start putting some enemies in, this should be approaching playable pretty quickly :)
