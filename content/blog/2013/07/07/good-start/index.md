So what with this weekend being Mrs. Beerman's birthday I didn't get a whole lot of time to start work on the new game. Managed to grab an hour or so to myself tonight though, and since I was ever so slightly fried from a weekend of beer and BBQ I didn't want to get stuck into the fiddly gameplay bits just yet so I needed to dinf something a bit simpler to fiddle with.

The plan calls for each level to be a different gig, so I thought a useful thing to have would be a random band name generator, just so that things aren't too samey. Here's a list of 20 names generated by my first attempt : 

<ul>
<li>dragonbomb</li>
<li>kickdemon</li>
<li>Erik and the hells</li>
<li>angelsteel</li>
<li>Bob and the wankers</li>
<li>bodywanker</li>
<li>witch at the fight</li>
<li>psycho Steve</li>
<li>The punch corpses</li>
<li>motorpuncher</li>
<li>ninjapuncher</li>
<li>black Fart</li>
<li>bombiron</li>
<li>devil over the body</li>
<li>helldevil</li>
<li>The metal angels</li>
<li>angry Erik</li>
<li>kickcorpse</li>
<li>The wank fists</li>
<li>The twisted diamonds</li>
</ul>
I think I'm onto a winner here :D
