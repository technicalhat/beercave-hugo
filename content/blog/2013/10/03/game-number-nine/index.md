So yeah, that's nine down, three more to go. I may actually finish this thing yet.

If there's one thing I've noticed so far with #1GAM, it's the months when I decide to make something content-heavy that really screw me over. Everything tends to start out well, then once I get the mechanics nailed down I realise I need to start doing some level design and it all goes a bit wrong.

So as <a href="http://www.beercave.co.uk/2013/09/25/mission-retromission-2013">previously mentioned,</a> for October I'm having a go at something that's pure game. Atari classic, Warlords

I'm actually looking forward to this one. Plan is to get it in a place where it's fun to play as quickly as possible then start sexying it up. I'll know I've got it right when I'm too busy playing it to do any more development...
