This weekend I took a break from swearing at Java to head on down to Oxford for the first <a href="http://www.retromission.co.uk/">Retromission</a> event. Rising from the ashes of the now sadly defunct Retrovision, we had a new name, a newly-
renamed pub, and more-or-less the same crowd of drinkers and gamers as usual.


Being an easily-led numpty, I'd let myself be talked into running one of the gaming competitions, and thus "Beerman's Beercade Homebrew Challenge" was born! A high score tournament across four top notch homebrew games made by event and associated forum regulars. With a flash of last-minute inspiration leading to having a homebrew beer kit as the prize, it turned out pretty well.

<h3>The Games<h3>

<h4><a href="http://ncot.piku.org.uk/ncot-p-007-dotshooter/">DotShooter</a> (NCOT Software)</h4>

<h4><a href="http://www.tcksoft.co.uk/wordpress/downloads/remakes/pangic-plus/">PANgIC PLUS</a> (TCKSoft)</h4>

<h4><a href="http://www.alexarisgames.co.uk/dpi.htm">Dead Pixel Invaders</a> (Alex Aris Games)</h4>

<h4><a href="http://www.beercave.co.uk/games/junohunter-prologue">Juno Hunter</a> (Some cowboy outfit called Beercave or something)</h4>

All-in-all the competition was a great success, and I'll definitely be up for organising a repeat at next year's event. With a bit of luck, it's inspired a few of the regulars to take a crack at making their own games as well.

Flush with the success of the homebrew contest, I decided to enter the Sunday afternoon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlords_(1980_video_game)">Warlords</a> tournament (well, technically it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Mayhem">Medieval Mayhem</a>). Despite (to my shame) never having played it before, I dominated the competition to secure myself the coveted trophy, and had a great time in the process.

I'm thinking that it might make an excellent candidate for October's game - simple, great fun, and feels like it could make a great 4 player tablet game. Apparently there's an iPad port out there but as far as I can tell there's nothing for Android. Now if I can just get Electric Sex Cannon finished before the end of the month...
