Another quick update on my racing game. Since the last update I've added textured roads and sprite scaling for cars and roadside scenery. Some of the test sprites I used may look a little familiar - obviously I need to replace those with some slightly more legal ones before release!

<strong style="width:600px; display:inline-block; text-align:center">This might actually turn out to be fun...</strong>

The sprite scaling looks to be very slightly out of sync with the road, but before I worry about that I think the next job is adding in some kind of control system - there's not much point in a racing game where you can't steer...

So obviously if I want to get this right the best course of action is to spend the weekend "researching" <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiWiTXq4yYY">OutRun</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAk27BvWpsg">Lotus</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3MEYIbchaE">Crazy Cars III</a> ;)
