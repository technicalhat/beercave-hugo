As <a href="/2013/04/07/april-magical-sound-showers">hinted at yesterday</a>, for April's game I'm working on an Outrun-style pseudo-3D racing game, based on the techniques described <a href="http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/">here.</a>

So far I'm two days in and I've got the basics of the renderer up and running and looking a little bit like this:

Needs a little tweaking to get the best out of the effect, but that should do to be going on with. Next up is proper textured roads and some roadside scenery - hopefully I should have something drivable by the weekend...
