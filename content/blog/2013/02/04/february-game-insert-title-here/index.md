Oh hey, look at that! It's February already, time to properly announce my second #1GAM creation.

As previously mentioned, this one was conceived as a mash-up of Spy Hunter and Juno First. Currently there's more Spy Hunter in there than anything, with just a hint of 3D projection taken from Juno First - I might come back to that later this year and do it properly.

This month will be one of the harder challenges since we're visiting Mrs. Beerman's family in Texas for a week, which cuts a chunk out of my dev time. Because I'm a smart chap I planned ahead for this by making sure my January game was simple enough to finish early, giving me an extra week to work on the next one. Because I'm not <i>always</i> a smart chap, I thought I'd give my productivity and focus a <i>spectacular</i> boost by buying Skyrim...

<strong style="width:600px; display:inline-block; text-align:center">What, this? Research, definitely research...</strong>


Still, I've managed to get at least some work done between bouts of twatting skeletons with a Big Fucking Axe, and I've got a fairly decent scrolling road up and running that looks a bit like this.

There's quite a nice Night Driver vibe going with the visuals there, next job is to add in some traffic and possibly some collectibles for points. Oh yeah, and some really over-the-top Fearon-esque particle explosions. I've got a nice update planned to the particle system from ChaosBall<a href="#footnote">*</a> which should let me explode everything in every direction at once. Using <i>All The Colours</i>, because that's how we do things around these parts.

Oh yeah, and a clever name would be good - I'm a bit stumped on this one. Hopefully something will come to me before the end of the month.



<a name="footnote">*</a>which was <i>shockingly</i> lazy. Every particle was its own entity, so on low-end phones the end game explosion was garbage-collection hell.
