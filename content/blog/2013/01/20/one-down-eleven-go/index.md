And it's done. My January <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com">One game a month</a> entry, ChaosBall is now available for download.

<a href="/games/chaosball">Get it here</a>

So that's the first game of the year released but there's no time to sit around congratulating myself. I've got 11 more still to go, and they're only gonna get harder from here on out.

What's up next then? I've got a big list of game ideas to play with, but the one that's really grabbing my interest right now is a sort of hybrid of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_Hunter">Spy Hunter</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_First">Juno First</a>(happy now, <a href="http://error-success.piku.org.uk/">Piku</a>? ;)

Hopefully I should have something to show off by the end of the week - got a week in Texas with Mrs. Beerman coming up in mid Feb so there's no time to waste on this one.
