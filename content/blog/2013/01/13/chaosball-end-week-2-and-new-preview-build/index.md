It's been a busy weekend here at the Beercave, with lots of new stuff added to ChaosBall. First up, new and exciting varieties of brick, in pretty colours and different sizes. I also turned down the brightness on the score digits as they were a bit too distracting.

Speaking of distracting, I built a new camera component so that I could move the viewpoint around. Obviously, to try it out I needed to attach it to something mobile...

Once I was happy with my camera system, I used it to add a bit of vibration to the screen every time the ball bounces. Add in a cracking ambient soundtrack from my good mate <a href="https://soundcloud.com/governmentyard">GovernmentYard</a> and it's looking pretty good.

Anyway, enough waffling from me. Download the new build and check it out!
