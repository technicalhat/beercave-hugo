Squeaking in just before the deadline again, that's my eleventh game of the year finished. And it's a really bloody nice too :D

The colours in the video are a bit washed out for some reason - the actual game looks more like this:

<span style="text-align:center;width:600px; display:block"><b>A bit more colourful!</b></span> 

So, there's just one more to go before the finish now, and being December there's only one place to take this : Christmas theme! December's game will be Brown Christmas, in which an angry Santa takes revenge on the naughty kids - by leaving a rather unexpected "present" in their stockings...
