Bit late for the pre-Christmas release I'd planned, but still comfortably inside the 1GAM deadline, game number twelve is Brown Christmas : a retro style multi-room platformer with a Christmas theme and added toilet humour. Because I'm a child :D

Which means I bloody well made it! I made 12 games in 12 months, and surprisingly a few of them are even quite decent. I'll do a proper retrospective post of the whole thing shortly, but for now I think it's time for a celebratory beer or 10!
