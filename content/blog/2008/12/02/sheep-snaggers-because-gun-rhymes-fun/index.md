Finally got weapons implemented tonight :D

Now I can finally defend the sheepies against the evil aliens. It's actually starting to feel like a game now :D

Next up, I want some enemies that shoot back, then it's time to activate the dreaded MarkieStar!

Once all that's done, all that's left is the polish. Menus, high scores, level balancing, attract mode. Sound might be good...
