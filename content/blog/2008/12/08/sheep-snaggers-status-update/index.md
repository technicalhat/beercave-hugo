Updated the alien generation code. Enemies are no longer spawned en-mass across the map at the start of the game. Instead, they warp in to the base star location every few seconds. Calms things down considerably from before where the deathstar was being completed in seconds.

Need to fine tune the ship handling and fire rate a little, maybe the bullet speed too - right now it's way too easy to hit an alien that's anywhere nearby.

Tweaked the attract screen for added psychedelia - starting to look pretty damn good :D

Next job is either enemy fighters or a deathstar that's actually dangerous. Reckon I need to equip it with some suitably scary weaponry.
