I ran across [something rather pretty](http://www.voxelvoid.com/) the other day on [Hacker 
News](http://news.ycombinator.com) :

<span style="text-align:center;display:block"><b>Ooh, shiny.</b></span> 

Which reminded me of a a couple of things.

 - Voxels look bloody lovely.
 - Particularly for the sort of simple, gameplay-heavy retro stuff that I like making.
 - I should make something with voxels, shouldn't I?

I'm thinking that as a handy distraction from avoiding work on my current project*, building something simple and shooty with voxels could be all kinds of fun **

So, using this [handy guide](https://sites.google.com/site/letsmakeavoxelengine/home) as a starting point I think I'm starting to get a grasp on the basic concept.

I'm thinking to keep things simple, a semi-fixed camera implementation (camera can translate but not rotate, so I don't need to do as much work on visibility-culling) would be a good place to start, and lends itself nicely to a whole bunch of fun retro games.

So, what would make a good first project? It needs to be fairly simple gameplay-wise, and ideally involve both 3D and some degree of screen scrolling (otherwise I could get away with a totally fixed camera). It's something that's been on my things-to-remake list for a while. And conveniently, it's the very first thing I thought of when I saw the preview image from the voxeloid video above.

I'm gonna take a crack at [Juno First](http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8261)!

 \* Yeah, I should probably write about that at some point as well. Been working on the damn thing for half a year now, maybe I should try actually, telling people about it or something...
