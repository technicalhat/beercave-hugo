It's no great secret that I like me some [Arena](/games/rogueotron-1gam-edition) [Shooter](/games/lagertron), so when [Rob](http://www.merseyremakes.co.uk/gibber/) started tweeting incessantly about something called [We Are Doomed](http://www.caffeinemonstersoftware.com/wearedoomed/) I figured I should give it a look. It's rather tasty...

For starters, it has the BEST GUN.

Yep. Just look at that fucker. One big old annihilating slice of laser-sword-flamethrower. 
And then there's the SuperBeam, which is like that, only MORE.

Bottom line, it looks stunning, plays great and makes me grin like a dickhead, which is pretty good going for $4

Like the sign your Mum carries around the docks says...
